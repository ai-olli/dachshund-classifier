# Dachshund Classifier - Short or long haired?

Let's deploy a model that can determine if a given picture shows a short haired or a long haired dachshund!

This project was inspired by reading chapter 2 of the "Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch" book, where a similar exercise was done using bears.

In this project, the model is already trained previously on the fastai library (using a GPU) and then exported.

Enjoy!
